# Helix Jump Clone
Clone of a game called Helix Jump

I tried to make a basic ProcGen system in this game.

The floors on the level are generated in a random number between 9 and 30.

At least one of the tiles on the floor is definitely empty, and at least one of them is definitely killer tile,

plus, there is a 10% probability that each tile will be empty,

and a 15% chance that it will be a killer.
